Exercise 6.1.1

Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

We have 4 possibilities

Sorted ascending T, sorted descending T: "" or "something"
Sorted ascending T, sorted descending F: "queue", "something"
Sorted ascending F, sorted descending T: "something", "queue"
Sorted ascending F, sorted descending F: "something, "a", "queue"
